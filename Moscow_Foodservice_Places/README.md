# Moscow Foodservice Places

Investors are planning to open a foodservice place in Moscow. They do not yet know what kind of place and what the location, menu and prices will be. The goal is to prepare a study of the Moscow foodservice market, find interesting features and present the results, that will help in choosing a suitable place for investors.

The project is presented as an html report without the data, because the dataset is the intellectual property of Yandex.Practicum.
