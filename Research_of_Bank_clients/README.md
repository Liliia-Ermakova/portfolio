# Research of Bank Clients

**The purpose of the study**:

* to analyze and segment the bank's customers by the number of products used.

**Research objectives**:

* to determine in which segments there is churn;
* give recommendations on new banking products to retain customers.

Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, testing statistical hypotheses, Tableau, data visualization.

**Recommendations**:

* Develop a product aimed at customers aged 40-65 years: more than half of these customers use only one product (most likely, a loan) and they have the highest percentage of churn rate (they paid off the loan and left). Such a product can be debit cards with cashback, loans for the education of children with a reduced rate, mortgage loans.

* Offer a new product to older customers from Rostov, for example, increased deposit rates for retired people. This will help to reduce churn, because the "65+" age segment has the highest loyalty.
