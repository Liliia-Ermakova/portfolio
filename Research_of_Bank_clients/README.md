# Research of Bank Clients

A regional bank with branches in Yaroslavl and the regional cities of Rostov and Rybinsk wants to know how customers use its services. The purpose of the study is to analyze and segment the bank's customers by the number of products used and to determine in which segments there is churn. 

The project is presented as an html report without the data, because the dataset is the intellectual property of Yandex.Practicum.
