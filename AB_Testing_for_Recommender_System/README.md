# A/B Testing for Recommender System

**The purpose of the research** is to assess the results of an A/B test of the improved recommender system.

Objectives:
* Evaluate the correctness of the test.
* Analyze the test results.

Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, A/B testing, testing statistical hypotheses.

As a result of the test, we can conclude that the new recommendation system decreases conversion. However, the test was carried out with significant deviations from the technical specifications. Therefore, it is recommended to restart the test.


The project is presented as an html report without the data, because the dataset is the intellectual property of Yandex.Practicum.
